This code implement a neural network to simulate the neural response under binocular rivalry.
The network including the follow layers of neurons: monocular, summation, opponency and attention neurons.
-runModel.m: this is the main m.file used to run the simulation. 
You can set the contrast os the two images (one for each eye) here by setting contrasts and rcontrast.
You can set the stimulus and attention state here by setting rstim. 
You can decide whether to save the simulated data in the Data folder by setting saveData as 1 or 0.
-n_model.m: this is the code running the simulation using Euler method.
